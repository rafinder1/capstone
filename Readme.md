# Final Project: Capstone

Final Project from Edx | Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Course. 
[Specification](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/final/capstone/)

### Description

__EPortfolio__ is a responsive, dynamic and most advanced web application that summarizes all my CS50's Web Programming 
with Python and JavaScript projects in one place. My application uses the Django plugin in Bootstrap mode. 
This application cost me the most work and was the most difficult to do. Anyone can see information about me, the course, 
and all my course projects. The EPortfolio application allows you to see the requirements of individual projects 
and watch a YouTube video showing them in action.

### Installation
Windows:
1. First of all let's clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/me50/rafinder1/tree/web50/projects/2020/x/capstone.git
```

2. In the root directory of the project (`cd capstone`), you can create a virtual environment using:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Then, to activate the virtual environment run:

```shell
venv/bin/activate.bat
```

4. And finally, to install all dependencies this project requires just run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should see a message saying that everything was installed.


### How to run? 
1. Go to the directory which contains "__manage.py__" file
2. Then type this command: 
3. ```shell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
3. In your Web browser use a URL: __http://127.0.0.1:8000/__


#### Distinctiveness and Complexity
The idea was to create a website for a EPortfolio which would be responsive to mobile and desktop designs, 
and focused on creating a better user interface and experience.

__I believe that my final project meets the requirements and is different from the previous ones.
It is also the most complex and uses many new elements.__ ❤️
